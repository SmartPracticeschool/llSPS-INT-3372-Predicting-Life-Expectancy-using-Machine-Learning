Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning

A remote internship project offered by SmartBridge

This project “Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning” is  an web application that predict the expected average life span of people of a given country based on various features.  This project is built using IBM services(Watson studio, Node Red, Watson machine learning). 
 
A typical Regression Machine Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future. This problem statement is aimed at predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country given various features. 
 
Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live, Life expectancy depends on various factors: Country, Status, infant deaths, GDP, Population, BMI, other  factors. This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given
